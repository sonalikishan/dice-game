dice game using DOM(document Object Model) and javascript
I made a simple dice game using Javascript. It is a Two player game to pass time. Rules goes as: 
If a player gets relatively bigger number on his/her respective dice than opposite player, there is a message displayed on the screen specifying who won.
If both get same numbers on their dice, then there is a DRAW. 
Refresh/Reload the page to start the game.
